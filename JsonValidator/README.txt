After running this program, you need to first give the path of the file to be tested.

The program will give the running result and running time after running.

Some correct and wrong test cases are included in folder jsonchecker.

Some larger test cases are included in folder jsonexamples.

There is a contrast of three files (larger than 2000kb) with origin code in origin_code_results.
